This repo is an example project to demonstrate storybook testing features,
including visual snapshotting, accessibility testing, and interaction testing.

## Usage

There are several branches that build on each other, with `main` being a basic storybook project with no testing set up.

To get started, install the necessary dependencies:

```shell
yarn install
```

Then, start up storybook with:

```shell
yarn storybook
```

Or, you can start the actual example app itself with:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Check out various branches, and be sure to run `yarn install` before restarting storybook.
